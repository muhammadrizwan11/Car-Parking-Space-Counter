Car Parking Space Counter
Overview
The Car Parking Space Counter project uses OpenCV to count and monitor available parking spaces in real-time. The system processes video feeds to detect and track parking spaces, providing actionable data to help optimize parking management.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks and counts parking spaces from video input.
Accurate Detection: Utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and count available spaces.
OpenCV Integration: Implemented using OpenCV for robust and efficient performance.
